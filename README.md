#Connectivity Orientation Spherical distribution Tool (COST)

##Warning

This software is still an alpha version

##What is it?

This tool implements the method from the paper "Efficient, Graph-based White Matter Connectivity from Orientation Distribution Functions via Multi-directional Graph Propagation," Proc. of SPIE 2011; 7962(79620S):1-8. However, with it we also seek to modify the method into a minimum cost-based approach and eventually test it on applications.
